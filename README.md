# EnlacFlexTable.js

**Straight to the point:** EnlacFlexTable.js was created to generate a table containing a scrollable tbody.

**About:** EnlacFlexTable.js was created by Enlac, who is still learning about development of softwares in general, thus it might look raw and amateur because it is.

**Goal:** EnlacFlexTable.js was developed after having a lot of issues while trying to fix the thead of tables in all major browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and IE. After looking for a solution for it I came to the conclusion that there were more problems on using an actual table than benefits, so I decided to create a jQuery based code that would generate a table width an scrollable tbody withought limiting of what you can do with the table, then EnlacFlexTable.js was born.

#Features
- Emulates a table in all its advantages
- Makes `tbody` scrollable when it overflows
